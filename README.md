# Personal Budget Management App

## About
This personal budget management app is a Java-based project initially developed for personal use and learning. The 
primary 
goal of this application is to effectively manage income and expenses with an emphasis on scalability and maintainability.

## Project Philosophy
- **Learning Through Doing**: This project serves as a learning platform for me to deepen my understanding of design patterns and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- **Design Patterns**: I'm implementing various design patterns, not just as a way to solve specific problems, but also to prepare the application for future scalability.
- **OOP Principles**: Emphasis is placed on programming to an interface, not an implementation, ensuring loose coupling and adhering to the principle of being open for extension but closed for modification.

## Current Progress
- The project is in its development phase and is a work in progress.
- Various design patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Observer are being integrated to provide a robust and flexible 
  architecture.
- The focus is on creating a modular structure that supports easy maintainability and scalability.

## Goals for the Future
- Extend functionality while maintaining the integrity of the design.
- Explore and integrate more design patterns as the project grows.
- Continuously refactor and improve the codebase to align with best practices in Java development.

## Contribution
As this is a personal project primarily for learning and experimentation, I'm currently not seeking contributions. 
However, I would love feedback or suggestions to help me improve.
